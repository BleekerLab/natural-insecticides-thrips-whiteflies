Code and datasets for the paper with keywords "natural insecticides / machine learning / thrips / whiteflies".

Eventually, all code and datasets used to generate the figures will be archived at the Zenodo repository (used by CERN). This will provide us with a link (DOI) that we can use in the methods section.
