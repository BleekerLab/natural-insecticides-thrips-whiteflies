Code and datasets for the paper "Enhanced screening of natural insecticides from wild tomatoes against whitefly and thrips (provisional title)". 

This is a private Github repository. Ask me if you want to have access to it. 

Eventually, all code and datasets used to generate the figures will be archived at the Zenodo repository (used by CERN). This will provide us with a link (DOI) that we can use in the methods section.
